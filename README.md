Coding skills demonstration files

I have a 15 year old site with 500 posts and lots of legacy hard mapping. Until very recently, it has been on WordPress. I recently converted it to static pages using Astro nodejs and mongodb. This was to ensure the speed that google now demands for seo. I have also used this project to refresh my programming skills after a decade or more doing IT Service Management consulting rather than direct technology work. The technology has changed dramatically durinig that time and the learnign curve has been significant but I have reached the confort stage with javascript, nodejs, and mongodb.

The old site had lots of hard coded links and accumulated mess of multiple plugins manipulating data over time. It takes time to review and update 500 posts and all the pages we have, so I have created tools to help with this such as the 404-routing file that corrects all the known routing issues on the fly and dynamically maps to the current links. Over time this will be corrected in the data. 

Most of my programming experience has been in creating smaller tools for manipulating specific data or solving specific problems where I either used the tool or directly supported the person using it. Consequently, I'm learning better error checking and other things necessary for published apps. 

I am focusing on javascript, php, nodejs, Astro, and mongodb. My previous experience was with visual basic, SQL Server, and Visual FoxPro which was an early desktop SQL tool that was much faster and more powerful than Access. I have extensive experience with WordPress including the php side of things. I have multiple MCSEs from way back with certs in SQL Server. I worked for Microsoft for 4 years as a Technical Account Manager getting SQL Server help from the best SQL Server support people there were. My technical background before becoming an ITIL Expert at Microsoft was on the network and datacener side of things. 

I traveled extensively for a lot of years as a Service Management consultant with Microsoft, Accenture, and Deloitte LLC. My interest now is in working remotely doing the programmign I have always enjoyed. Many thanks to Elon Musk and StarLink, I now have sufficient internet access to work remotely from deep in the woods where I live now. 

I will be adding to this demo branch from time to time as I clean up my tools and make them presentable.
